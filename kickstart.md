# Clojure Kickstart

Most people with a background in static imperative OO programming face
initial difficulties in getting started with a dynamic Lisp-style
functional language like [Clojure](http://clojure.org/). Which is sad
because programming in Clojure is a great experience!

The first hurdle is setting up a decent development environment that
lets you enjoy the interactive nature of Clojure.

The next step would be to have a toy project. It should do
significantly more than print `Hello World`, and it must have a direct
connection to everyday programming tasks.

And finally, novices should get a well-chosen list of
[hints and links](https://github.com/friemen/cugb/blob/master/getting-started.md)
to continue learning on their own.

## Welcome to the Kickstart workshop

The three things listed above are exactly what we try to accomplish in
a 4-hour workshop. Don't expect having mastered the language
afterwards, but you can expect to be well-prepared for learning
Clojure and deep-dive into it's ecosystem.

And this is how we get you started:
 * Setup a development environment. We can support you with
   [LightTable](http://www.lighttable.com/),
   [Cursive](https://cursiveclojure.com/) (IntelliJ),
   [Counterclockwise](http://doc.ccw-ide.org/documentation.html)
   (Eclipse) or [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)
   (Emacs).
 * Create your own Clojure project with [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/).
 * Learn to deal with a
   [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
   and structural editing (a.k.a ParEdit)
 * Create your first web app.
 * Introduction to the syntax and some important functions.
 * Let you play around and answer your questions.

And if you want to continue learning Clojure afterwards, you can also
join one of the local user groups in
[Bonn](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure-user-group-bonn)
and [Cologne](http://www.meetup.com/clojure-cologne/).

## Prerequisites for participation

Each participant should have an own notebook with
[Java](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/) (version >= 6) installed.

Prior amateur knowledge of at least one programming language (for
example C++, Python, Ruby, Java, any Lisp, Scala) is very helpful.

## Organizational requirements

* Max. number of participants: 10
* A room with decent power supply
* Internet access
* Beamer (we can bring our own)
