# Some algorithmic practicums in Clojure

Here are the exercises:

## Prime numbers
Find all prime numbers up to N.

The idea using the Sieve of Eratosthenes is to initially list all numbers from 2 to N.
Start with the first P which is guaranteed to be prime, then remove all multiples of P.
Continue with the next until P > sqrt(N)

See the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) for further explanation.


## Square root calculation

Given a number N, find the square root of N.

The Babylonian method of square root approximation starts with
an initial guess G\_0 of a solution.

Given a guess G\_n a better solution is always G\_n+1 := (N / G\_n + G\_n) / 2.

Repeat this until the error is small enough.

## Topological ordering of a graph

The task is to create a topological order of all nodes of a graph.
See [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) to find out what this is.

The graph can be represented as a map:

```clojure
(def g {:a []
        :b [:a]
        :c []
        :d [:c :b]
        :e [:a :b :c :d]})
```

The top-order of the a graph like above is `(:e :d :c :b :a)`. 


## Partition by Equality

Define a function partition-by-eq that takes
a binary predicate p and a sequence xs and returns
a sequence of partitions.

The elements of a sub-sequence X\_1 to X\_n belong to the
same partition if all (p X\_1 X\_2) to (p X\_n-1 X\_n) hold true.

Example of application:
`(partition-by-eq < [1 2 3 2 3 4])` will produce `((1 2 3) (2 3 4))`.
