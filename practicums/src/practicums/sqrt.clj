(ns practicums.sqrt)

;; Given a number N, find the square root of N
;;
;; The Babylonian method of square root approximation starts with
;; an initial guess G_0 of a solution.
;; Given a guess G_n a better solution is always G_n+1 := (N / G_n + G_n) / 2
;; Repeat this until the error is small enough.
