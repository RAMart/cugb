# Programme

**In the morning: Talks**

Title | Speaker
--- | ---
About Scheme | Moritz Heidkamp, bevuta
Emacs Lisp | Vasilij Schneidermann
Clojure in Production | Gerrit Hentschel, doo

**In the afternoon: Hands-on**

As a gentle introduction we begin with "Clojure in 90 Minutes" by Ingo KÃ¼per, doctronic

We continue with a *Clojure Kickstart Workshop*:

Most people with a background in static imperative OO programming face
initial difficulties in getting started with a dynamic Lisp-style
functional language like [Clojure](http://clojure.org/). Which is sad
because programming in Clojure is a great experience.

We can help!
